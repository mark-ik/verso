## Design Decisions

### 1. Interaction Model: Click Behavior & Keybinds

- Left-Click: Select node (highlight on canvas)
- Double-Click: Launch document (open detail window)
- Right-Click: Context menu
- Left-Click + Drag: Lasso (select multiple nodes)
- WASD / Arrow Keys: Panning
- Q + E / Scroll Wheel: Zooming
- Space: Search/filter
- F: Previous node (chronologically)
- R: Next node
- (All keybinds remappable in Settings)


---

### 2. **Graph Implementation: Custom vs Petgraph**

**Current Migration Plan says**:
- Custom graph implementation in `src/graph/`
- Full control; tailored to use case

**Verse Reference + Sketch Notes suggest**:
- Petgraph (battle-tested library)
- Saves ~200 lines of code
- Gains built-in algorithms (clustering, shortest path, DFS/BFS)
- Trade-off: Less control; adds dependency

**Conflict?** No; this is a **design decision not yet made**.

**Recommendation**:
- **Phase 1**: Use custom implementation (current plan) — no delay, not a blocker
- **Phase 1.5**: Evaluate Petgraph in experimental branch
- **Phase 2**: Decide based on evaluation
  - If Petgraph works: Migrate; use algorithms for clustering
  - If custom is better: Keep custom; no regrets

---

### 3. **UI Framework: egui vs Xilem + Vello**

**Current Migration Plan says**:
- egui (immediate mode)
- WebRender for graph composition

**Verse Reference suggests**:
- Xilem + Vello (declarative, modern)
- Lighter than WebRender
- Better long-term architecture

**Resolution**: 
- **Phase 1**: Use egui (faster prototyping)
- **Phase 2**: Evaluate Xilem + Vello
- Modular UIBackend trait allows swapping later

---

### 4. **Browser Engine: Servo vs Tao + Wry**

**Current Migration Plan says**: Servo (full browser engine)

**Alternative**: Tao + Wry (lighter, OS-native rendering)

**Status**: Not a contradiction; both are viable.

**Resolution**: 
- **Phase 1**: Use Servo (committed, pipeline working)
- **Phase 3+**: Support Tao + Wry as alternative BrowserEngine implementation

---

### 5. **Architecture: Modular from Phase 1**

**Current Migration Plan says**: Modular verso-graph-core library + pluggable engines (Phase 1)

**Rationale**: 
- Cleaner separation of concerns (graph logic independent of UI/browser)
- Easier testing and iteration on physics/rendering without UI overhead
- verso-graph-core can be published and reused immediately
- Pluggable BrowserEngine + UIBackend traits enable future alternatives (Tao+Wry, Xilem+Vello)

**Resolution**: 
- **Phase 1**: Build modular from day one
  - verso-graph-core library: Graph, physics, rendering, traits (zero Servo/egui dependencies)
  - verso app: Servo integration + egui UI layer
- **Phase 2+**: Extend with alternative engines as needed
- **Phase 3+**: verso-graph-core published; community extensions use it

---

## Misalignments: Current Plan Missing from Philosophy/Sketches

### 1. 🟡 **Session Management Not Explicit in Current Plan**

**Project Philosophy says**:
- "Save, delete, or share historical sessions"
- Sessions as first-class concept (Phase 2 priority)

**Current Migration Plan says**:
- "Save/load graph" (Phase 2)
- No explicit "sessions" concept; just graph persistence

**Not a contradiction, but a mismatch in emphasis**:
- Current plan treats graph as single artifact
- Philosophy treats sessions as separate browsing contexts

**Recommendation**:
- **Phase 2**: Implement sessions explicitly
  - Menu: "New session" (auto-saves previous graph)
  - Directory: `~/.verso/sessions/` (JSON files)
  - Each session is a distinct graph snapshot
  - History view shows past sessions (searchable by date/tags)

---

### 2. 🟡 **Sidebar Option Not in Current Plan**

**Project Philosophy says**:
- "Optional sidebar window manager for people who still want tabs" (Phase 2)

**Current Migration Plan says**:
- Detail windows on click
- No mention of sidebar alternative

**Not a contradiction; just missing from current plan**:
- Could add in Phase 2 as "View → Show sidebar" toggle
- Sidebar lists all open nodes as rows; click to focus; right-click to close

**Recommendation**:
- **Phase 2**: Add optional sidebar
  - Toggle in View menu or settings
  - Shows list of open nodes (like traditional tabs)
  - Click to switch focus; right-click to close

---

### 3. 🟡 **DOM Inspector UI Not Detailed in Current Plan**

**Project Philosophy says**:
- "DOM/element inspector that lets you pull elements out into the graph"
- Needs visual tool for selection

**Current Migration Plan says**:
- "DOM extraction" (Phase 2)
- No UI detail for inspector/selection

**Not a contradiction; just needs specification**:
- Right-click element → "Extract to graph"?
- Or hotkey to toggle "inspect mode" (highlight on hover, click to select)?

**Recommendation**:
- **Phase 2 spec**: Detail inspector UI
  - Option A: Right-click context menu on elements
  - Option B: Hotkey (Ctrl+E) to toggle inspect mode; click to select
  - Create node with element content + source metadata

---

### 4. 🟡 **Share Individual Nodes (Distinct from Graph Export)**

**Project Philosophy says**:
- "Share individual nodes as URLs with metadata" (Phase 3)

**Current Migration Plan says**:
- "Export graph as JSON" (Phase 2)
- Node-level sharing not mentioned

**Not a contradiction; complementary features**:
- Graph export: Full structure
- Node sharing: Individual nodes as links/metadata

**Recommendation**:
- **Phase 3**: Add node-level sharing
  - Node detail window: "Share" button
  - Generates link: `verso://node?id=abc123&title=...&url=...&tags=...`
  - Or export node as standalone JSON/HTML card

---

### 5. 🟡 **Ghost Nodes Not Mentioned**

**Project Philosophy says**:
- "Use ghost nodes to preserve structure when removing items"
- When node deleted, show ghost edges (dashed/faded) to preserve knowledge of connections

**Current Migration Plan says**:
- Node deletion removes node entirely
- No concept of ghost edges

**Not a contradiction; just a feature not included**:
- Low-priority enhancement
- Could add as Phase 2+ feature

**Recommendation**:
- **Phase 2 (low-priority)**: Add optional "Show ghost connections"
  - When node deleted, create visual-only "GhostEdge"
  - Render as dashed/faded line
  - Toggle in settings

---

## Summary: Are There Contradictions?

### ✅ **Hard Contradictions (Breaking Conflicts)** 
**NONE.** All documents harmonize on core vision, phases, and success metrics.

### 📋 **Design Decisions (Not Contradictions—All Have Clear Paths)**
1. **Interaction model**: Single-click select + double-click open vs click→detail
   - Resolution: Current plan uses select+double-click; test one-click alternative in Phase 1.5
2. **Graph library**: Custom vs Petgraph
   - Resolution: Use custom for Phase 1; evaluate Petgraph in Phase 1.5
3. **UI framework**: egui vs Xilem + Vello
   - Resolution: Use egui for Phase 1; benchmark in Phase 2
4. **Browser engine**: Servo vs Tao + Wry
   - Resolution: Use Servo for Phase 1; support Tao+Wry as alternative in Phase 3+


### 🔗 **Missing Features (Phase 2+, Not Contradictions)**
1. **Session management**: Explicit sessions concept with `~/.verso/sessions/` directory
2. **Sidebar option**: Optional toggle for traditional tab-like sidebar
3. **DOM inspector UI**: Visual tool for element selection and extraction
4. **Node-level sharing**: Share individual nodes as links (distinct from graph export)
5. **Ghost nodes**: Optional visual-only edges when nodes are deleted (low priority)

---

## Recommendations for Resolving

### Immediate (Before Phase 1 Starts)
1. **Interaction model locked**: Single-click select + double-click launch is the current plan
   - **Alternative to test in Phase 1.5**: One-click open (skip select step)
2. **Document philosophy**: Add Project Philosophy section to GRAPH_BROWSER_MIGRATION.md
   - Explain personal experiment nature, sense-making focus, rough edges OK

### Phase 1 (During Implementation)
1. **Graph library**: Use custom; no need to decide now
2. **UI framework**: Use egui; no need to decide now
3. **Architecture**: Build modular from day one (verso-graph-core + verso app)

### Phase 1.5 (1–2 weeks, reflection period)
1. **Test interaction model alternative**: Try one-click open mode; compare to select+double-click
2. **Evaluate Petgraph**: Prototype graph layer with Petgraph; compare to custom
3. **Document learnings**: What's missing? What surprised you?
4. **Prioritize Phase 2** based on actual use, not speculation

### Phase 2 (Implementation)
1. **Add session management**: Explicit sessions concept + history view
2. **Add sidebar option**: Optional tab-like sidebar for users who prefer it
3. **Detail DOM inspector UI**: Specify selection mechanism in Phase 2 spec
4. **Evaluate UI frameworks**: Benchmark egui vs Xilem + Vello; decide for Phase 2.5+
5. **Evaluate graph library**: If Petgraph looks good, migrate during Phase 2 cleanup

## Phase 3+ Deep Dive: Tokenization & P2P Network Model

### The Report-Based Network

**Fundamental unit: The Report**

A "report" is a recorded jump from one webpage to another:
- **Source page**: URL, title, metadata, favicon
- **Destination page**: URL, title, metadata, favicon
- **Transition metadata**: Timestamp, duration spent on source, user-initiated or redirect
- **Optional signed data**: Device info (browser, OS, version), application metadata, geolocation (user-opt-in)

Users can:
1. **Keep report private**: Retained in personal browsing history (~/.verso/sessions/)
2. **Contribute report to network**: Tokenize the report for network sharing

### Tokenization: Privacy + Access Control

**Tokenizing a report** means:
1. **Anonymization**: Remove personally identifying information (exact location→region, device fingerprint→device class)
2. **Create immutable NFT token**: Unique nonfungible identifier for this anonymized report; prevents duplication
3. **User gets NFT token**: User's wallet now holds this nonfungible report token; they can access their own anonymized history across devices via token ownership

**Benefits**:
- **Cross-device browsing history**: User can load their tokens on a new device and access their history
- **Privacy-first**: Network never sees raw personal data; only anonymized reports
- **Data ownership**: User is the data subject *and* the data owner; NFTs prove ownership
- **Security**: Tokens act like bearer credentials; user controls who/what can access their history
- **Tradeability**: Users can sell or trade specific valuable report NFTs to other users

### Token Economy: Value & Markets

**Two-token system: NFT reports + fungible access tokens**

**NFT Report Tokens (nonfungible)**
- Each report NFT is unique, representing a specific webpage transition
- Users own and can trade them individually
- Each NFT has its own value curve based on novelty and freshness
- Users can:
  - Keep private (personal history only)
  - Contribute to network (share with broker/peers for profit)
  - Sell or trade to other users (who want access to that specific report data)

**Fungible Access Tokens (utility tokens)**
- Represents the right to query and pull significant volumes of network data
- Comes from two sources:
  1. **Profit from selling/licensing NFT reports**: User contributes NFT report → network broker acquires data → broker pays user in fungible tokens
  2. **Reputational awards**: Users who contribute high-quality, diverse reports get fungible token rewards from the network
- **Intrinsic value**:
  - Access to consensually-shared browsing data (can query large datasets)
  - Participation in network economics (holding tokens gives vote/stake in protocol decisions)
  - Broader ecosystem value (as network grows, access tokens become more valuable)

**Value dynamics**:
- Individual NFT value declines over time: $V_{NFT}(t) = V_0 \cdot e^{-\lambda t}$ (novelty depreciation)
- Fungible token value rises with network growth (more data → more valuable access rights)
- Users leverage NFT profits (paid in fungible tokens) to purchase access and query network
- Example flow:
  1. User contributes NFT report about obscure docs site → high novelty
  2. Network broker finds value in that report → pays user 100 access tokens
  3. User spends 50 access tokens to query network for "which browsers load this site fastest?"
  4. User holds 50 access tokens as store of value (network utility stake)

**Token lifecycle**:
- **NFT revoke**: User pays diminishing fungible tokens to remove their NFT from network (cost decreases as NFT value declines)
- **NFT sell**: User can sell NFT directly to another user; buyer gets permanent access to that report data
- **NFT expire**: After time $T$, NFT expires and network access automatically revokes (unless sold)
- **Fungible tokens**: No expiration; pure utility and store of value

### Enhanced Value: Signed Metadata

Users can **optionally sign reports with additional metadata** to increase network value:
- **Browser/application data**: Web browser version, rendering engine version, enabled features
- **Device info**: OS, device class (desktop/phone/tablet), hardware capabilities
- **Geolocation**: Region/country (at resolution user chooses)

**Network use case**: Build quality metrics for the web
- "How successful is Chrome 120 at rendering this website?"
- "Does this page load faster on iOS vs Android?"
- "In which regions is this service accessible?"

Users who provide signed reports get *higher* profit multipliers (paid in fungible tokens) because the data is more valuable to the network. This incentivizes contribution while maintaining user privacy (all data is still anonymized).

### Network Effects & Data Marketplace

**Phase 3+ evolution into ecosystem**:
- **NFT report market**: Users trade specific valuable reports (e.g., "this obscure SaaS tool works great on MacOS")
- **Fungible token economy**: Brokers acquire NFT reports, aggregate them into datasets, sell bulk access for fungible tokens
- **Data curators**: Users who bundle high-value NFTs into themed collections (e.g., "best developer tools by platform") and sell the bundle
- **Query market**: Network allows complex queries (e.g., "find all reports about sites that load >2s on mobile in US") priced in fungible tokens
- **Reputation system**: Prolific contributors get fungible token rewards; their contributions become more trusted/valuable

**Network incentive structure**:
- Users want to contribute: NFT profits + reputational rewards
- Brokers want to aggregate: Buy cheap NFTs, resell data access at higher fungible token price
- Queriers want access: Spend fungible tokens to get valuable insights
- Network grows stronger: More data → more valuable access tokens → more incentive to contribute

### MVP Path (Phase 3+)

**Phase 3 minimum viable**: 
1. Report structure + NFT token generation (local only, no network yet)
2. Dual token wallet UI (view, import, export NFT reports + fungible tokens)
3. Local report signing (optional metadata)
4. Proof-of-concept network (LAN or single server) for testing
   - Basic broker: accepts NFT reports, pays users fungible tokens
   - Simple query: search reports by site/device/region
   - Reputation: track contributor quality

**Phase 3+ evolution**:
1. IPFS or similar for distributed report storage
2. Consensus protocol for NFT valuation + fungible token supply
3. DEX or bonding curve for NFT trading + fungible token liquidity
4. Query interface for accessing network data (priced in fungible tokens)
5. Analytics dashboards showing web quality metrics
6. Data curator platform (bundle valuable NFTs, sell access)
7. Broker ecosystem (intermediaries who aggregate and resell data)

### Token Supply: Storage-Backed Bonding Curve

**Core insight:** Token supply should be backed by network storage capacity, not arbitrary formulas.

**Mechanism:**

Peers join Verse by committing storage:
- "I will store 100 GB of reports/indexes for 6 months" → Network allocates tokens equivalent to that commitment
- Peer now holds tokens and can spend them immediately OR hold as store of value
- Peer earns additional tokens from fees (rebroadcasting, deduplicating, attesting)
- After 6 months, peer can renew commitment or exit
- If peer goes offline/doesn't honor commitment, network slashes some tokens (PoH audit catches this)
- Pay-as-you-go model is preferred, but these commitments are technically possible and validatable in retrospect.

**Token allocation formula:**

```
Tokens allocated to peer = (Storage committed in GB) × (Price per GB) × (Reputation multiplier)

Example:
- Peer commits 100 GB for 6 months
- Network price: 1 token per GB per month (can adjust)
- Peer has 0.5 year reputation multiplier (new peer)
- Allocation: 100 GB × 1 token/GB × 0.5 = 50 tokens
- Experienced peer (2 year history): 100 × 1 × 2 = 200 tokens
```

**Supply dynamics:**

| Network State | Action | Result |
|---|---|---|
| High demand, low storage | More peers want to host | Token supply grows → incentivizes new peers |
| Low demand, excess storage | Peers' storage underutilized | Token supply contracts → existing peers profitable |
| Growing network | More queries, higher fees | Storage becomes more valuable → attracts more peers |

**Self-regulating:** If token value drops, fewer peers commit storage → supply shrinks → value recovers. No governance required; market equilibrium.

**Sybil resistance:** Can't fake storage. Each committed GB is audited periodically via PoH (Merkle tree of data served, spot-check verification). Faking requires actually buying hardware.

**Pay-as-you-go token earning (refined model):**

Rather than fixed-term commitments, peers earn tokens in real-time based on uptime:

```
Tokens earned per hour = (Storage online in GB) × (Uptime % in that hour) × (Rate per GB-hour)

Example:
- Peer has 100 GB online
- Network rate: 0.001 tokens per GB-hour
- Peer online 24/7 for a month: 100 GB × 730 hours × 0.001 = 73 tokens
- Peer goes offline after 1 day: 100 GB × 24 hours × 0.001 = 2.4 tokens (no penalty, just stops earning)
- Peer adds 50 GB: earnings increase to 0.15 tokens/hour (instead of 0.1)
```

**Key advantages:**
- ✅ **Zero lock-in**: Start/stop anytime; no commitment
- ✅ **Immediate feedback**: See earnings within hours
- ✅ **Voluntary**: Keep online only if profitable
- ✅ **Self-regulating**: More peers = higher issuance; fewer peers = supply shrinks → value recovers

**Reputation multiplier** (optional):
- New peer (< 3 months): 0.5x rate
- Established peer (1 year): 1.0x rate  
- Trusted peer (5+ years): 2.0x rate
- Per-Verse governance can adjust multipliers

**Supply dynamics with pay-as-you-go:**

Network struggles → peers go offline → supply shrinks → remaining peers earn more → equilibrium restored (no governance needed).

**Advantages over generic bonding curve:**

1. ✅ **Backed by real resource**: Each token represents actual storage capacity peers are providing
2. ✅ **No magic supply**: Tokens emerge from peer contributions, not arbitrary minting
3. ✅ **Spam resistance**: Flooding network with junk NFTs doesn't inflate token supply unless someone stores it
4. ✅ **Bootstrap built-in**: You contribute 500 GB → get tokens → can pay early users for reports
5. ✅ **Scalable incentives**: As network grows, more peers need storage → more tokens available → can pay more users

**Implementation challenges:**

1. **Storage verification** (PoH audit trail): Peers publish Merkle roots of data chunks; network spot-checks by requesting random chunks and verifying hashes
2. **Regional normalization**: Storage costs vary by geography; network might offer regional multipliers (cheaper regions = smaller allocation)
3. **Replication strategy**: If report is replicated 5x, do all 5 peers get tokens? 
   - **Option A (Incentivize replication)**: Yes, all 5 peers get tokens; encourages redundancy
   - **Option B (Deduplicate supply)**: No, only 1 peer's storage counts toward supply; prevents artificial inflation
   - **Recommendation: Option A** for Phase 3 (simpler, encourages resilience); Option B for Phase 3.2+ (optimize for efficiency)
4. **Price discovery**: Initial network price per GB negotiated by community or set conservatively; adjusts based on supply/demand

**Phase 3 MVP implementation:**

```
1. Peer signals: "I commit 100 GB for 6 months"
2. Network: "Here's your 50 tokens" (conservative initial allocation)
3. Peer stores data; serves queries
4. Every month, network audits: spot-checks 1% of data via random chunk verification
5. Audit passes → tokens remain; audit fails → slashing (5-10% deducted)
6. After 6 months, peer renews or leaves
```

**This elegantly connects three pieces:**
- **Report storage** (actual IPFS/DHT data)
- **Index/data chain** (Merkle proofs of what's stored)
- **Token supply** (backed by storage capacity peers contribute)

Verse token supply becomes a **storage reserve currency**, not fiat.

### Governance: Federated Communities & Verse Protocol

**Global governance is minimized; local governance is maximized.**

**The Global Layer (Verso Protocol):**
- Report format standard (JSON schema, signature requirements)
- P2P networking protocol (DHT, peer discovery, message format)
- Storage proof mechanism (PoH Merkle audit)
- Cross-Verse interoperability specs (optional; backwards compatibility aspired to but not required)

Everything else—token rates, community rules, moderation standards—is **per-Verse**, not global.

**Verse Creation & Governance:**

A "Verse" is an independent network instance with its own token and parameters:

```
To create a Verse:
1. Stake N tokens (creates initial token pool)
2. Define parameters: token rate, community rules, indexing strategy
3. Invite peers to join; they can add their own storage
4. Operate independently (no coordination with other Verses needed)
5. Tokens earned by peers belong to that Verse only
```

**Example ecosystem:**

```
Verse: #programming
├── Token rate: 0.001 tokens/GB-hour
├── Community rules: Quality, cite sources, no spam
├── Curator: alice (stakes 500 tokens)
├── Peers: 50 rebroadcasters contributing 5 TB
└── Token pool: Growing from storage commitment + query fees

Verse: #local-news
├── Token rate: 0.002 tokens/GB-hour (higher to bootstrap)
├── Community rules: Regional sourcing only
├── Curator: bob (stakes 1000 tokens)
├── Peers: 10 local rebroadcasters
└── Token pool: Smaller but tight-knit

Verse: #open-everything
├── Token rate: 0.0005 tokens/GB-hour
├── Community rules: Minimal moderation
├── Curator: charlie (stakes 100 tokens)
├── Peers: Many anonymous nodes
└── Token pool: High volume, low profit-per-peer
```

**Adjusting token rates per Verse:**

Each Verse can modify its economic parameters by governance within that Verse:
- **Increase rate**: Add more tokens to the network wallet (for growth/competition)
- **Decrease rate**: Remove tokens from network wallet (to prevent inflation)
- **Adjust distribution**: Change how tokens flow to rebroadcasters vs deduplicators vs attesters
- **Create buffer**: Hold reserve tokens for future expansion or stability

**No single authority**: Each Verse is self-governing. If alice's #programming Verse raises rates too high, peers leave for bob's #local-news. If charlie's #open-everything gets flooded with spam, peers route through better-moderated Verses.

**Cross-Verse compatibility:**

- Reports created in one Verse (NFTs) can be imported to another (all Verses use same report format)
- Users can participate in multiple Verses simultaneously
- Peers can choose which Verses to seed/attest for
- Different Verses can evolve at different speeds; backwards compatibility is aspirational but not required
  - Like how Bitcoin nodes can run v0.10 or v27.0 on the same network with negotiated compatibility
  - Or how you could run an older Verse protocol version in isolation if you preferred

**This solves the governance problem by dissolving it:**
- No global governance needed (Verso protocol is stable, boring, minimalist)
- Each Verse governs itself (economic parameters, community rules)
- Communities fork naturally (if you disagree with alice's #programming rules, create #programming-fork)
- Users vote with their participation (route queries through Verses they trust)

### Beyond Browsing Reports: Generalized Decentralized Storage

**Verse isn't limited to browsing reports.** The same infrastructure can store anything:

- **Browsing data** (default): Reports of webpage transitions
- **Files**: Personal documents, media, archives (encrypted or public)
- **Media**: Images, video, audio (curated by community, gated or public)
- **Forums**: Discussion threads, comments (like decentralized Reddit)
- **Social feeds**: User posts, timelines (like decentralized Twitter)
- **Applications**: Web apps hosted on IPFS, accessible through Verso or browsers
- **Private documents**: Encrypted storage with access control (you grant peers keys)

**Each Verse decides what to store:**

```
Verse: #browsing (browsing reports only)
├── Content filter: Only webpage transitions
├── Token rate: 0.001 tokens/GB-hour
└── Use case: Web quality metrics

Verse: #files (general file storage)
├── Content filter: Any file type allowed
├── Token rate: 0.002 tokens/GB-hour (higher for general use)
└── Use case: Decentralized Dropbox

Verse: #media (image/video/audio)
├── Content filter: Media only; must be properly tagged
├── Token rate: 0.003 tokens/GB-hour (higher storage per file)
└── Use case: Decentralized Flickr/YouTube

Verse: #private (encrypted, gated)
├── Content filter: Encrypted blobs; access control by key
├── Token rate: 0.001 tokens/GB-hour (encrypted, can't index)
└── Use case: Personal secure cloud storage
```

**Tokens are truly storage-backed** — regardless of content:

```
Token earn rate = (Storage committed in GB) × (Uptime %) × (Rate per GB-hour)
```

Works the same whether you're storing:
- Browser reports (small, structured JSON)
- 4K video files (large, bandwidth-intensive)
- Private encrypted documents (medium, access-controlled)
- Forum discussions (medium, community-moderated)

**This generalizes to any application:**

You could run:
- A decentralized photo sharing app (stores images, charges in Verse tokens)
- A private journal app (encrypted storage, Verso manages access)
- A collaborative document platform (stored on Verse, real-time sync via websockets)
- A podcast hosting service (media storage, pay peers in tokens)
- A file sync tool (like Syncthing but with incentives)

**The analogy to Filecoin is apt, but with key differences:**

| Aspect | Filecoin | Verse |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Token backing** | Storage (PoRep) | Storage (PoH uptime) |
| **Pricing** | Global market | Per-Verse governance |
| **Content curation** | None (any content) | Per-Verse rules (communities moderate) |
| **Governance** | Global protocol | Federated Verses |
| **Applications** | Any (generic storage) | Any (generic storage) |
| **Social layer** | None | Communities, reputation, peer refusal |

Verse is like **Filecoin + Reddit + Mastodon**: decentralized storage with economics, community curation, and social reputation.

**Why this matters:**

Instead of:
- Dropbox (centralized, censored)
- AWS S3 (centralized, expensive)
- IPFS (decentralized, no incentives, pinning unreliable)
- Filecoin (decentralized, economic, but no community layer)

You get:
- Decentralized storage ✅
- Economic incentives ✅
- Community curation ✅
- Multiple governance models (pick your Verse) ✅
- Privacy options (encrypted Verses) ✅
- Reputation systems (earn trust) ✅

### The Unified Model: Cryptographic Permissions + Community + Economics

Everything revolves around **cryptographically enforced access permissions** laddering from personal to public:

**Your choice → Community rules → Access permissions:**

```
What you share about your browsing
↓
Verso app: You decide what to include (device/location/browser signing)
↓
Your NFT report (private by default)
↓
Choose which Verse to submit to:
  - Join #programming → community rules filter for quality
  - Join #open-data → minimal curation
  - Create private Verse → only share with friends
↓
Cryptographic permissions determine access:
  - Public: Anyone can query
  - Token-gated: Must spend tokens to access
  - Privately encrypted: Only you can decrypt
  - Access-controlled: You grant specific peers/apps permission
↓
Curator's terms determine what happens next:
  - #programming curator: High quality expected, reputation matters
  - #open-data curator: Minimal rules, high volume
  - Your private Verse: Your rules entirely
```

**This applies to all content types:**

- **Browsing reports**: Share some data publicly, some privately, some token-gated
- **Files**: Store publicly, privately encrypted, or access-controlled
- **Media**: Community-curated galleries, gated archives, private albums
- **Applications**: Web apps running on Verse infrastructure, with cryptographic access control
- **Databases**: Shared datasets with granular permissions

**Web applications as infrastructure:**

Verse isn't just for storage; it can host and run web applications:

```
Example: Collaborative note-taking app
- App code: Stored on IPFS, served through Verse
- App data: Stored in encrypted Verse storage (your notes)
- Access: Cryptographic permission keys (share with collaborators)
- Economics: You pay tokens to store/serve; collaborators contribute storage; app is self-funding
- Community: Runs in #collaboration Verse; curator ensures quality; reputation tracks app reliability

Example: Decentralized Reddit fork
- Community: Each subreddit is a separate Verse
- Content: Posts stored with encrypted signatures
- Access: Thread-level permissions (public, members-only, private discussion)
- Economics: Mods/contributors earn tokens from activity in their community
- Governance: Each Verse decides moderation policy; users join Verses they trust

Example: Private file sync (like Syncthing)
- App: Sync daemon running locally, pushes to Verse
- Storage: Your encrypted documents on Verse
- Access: Cryptographic keys shared with other devices/people
- Economics: You earn tokens if others store via your node; pay tokens for your own storage
```

**The coherence:**

Everything is unified by:
1. **Cryptography** (who can see what)
2. **Community** (who decides what's valuable)
3. **Economics** (storage tokens incentivize participation)
4. **User choice** (pick your Verses, curators, permission levels)

You don't need:
- Centralized servers
- Centralized governance
- Centralized moderation
- Centralized pricing

Each Verse, community, and application decides these for itself. Users choose which ones to trust.

This is genuinely a different model from:
- **Web2** (centralized platforms, centralized rules, centralized economics)
- **Web3** (decentralized networks, global governance, no community layer)

It's **decentralized + community-curated + economically sustainable**.

### Decentralized Network Architecture: Peer Roles

Without a central server, the network needs **differentiated peer roles** to handle validation, deduplication, and curation. Each role has different operational requirements and earns fungible tokens accordingly.

**1. Regular Users (Leaf Peers)**
- Run Verso locally; submit reports to network
- Earn: Fungible tokens from selling/licensing their NFT reports
- Obligations: Minimal (just submit valid reports with proper signatures)
- Infrastructure: None; use light client protocol
- Incentive: Direct profit from their data

**2. Rebroadcasters (Full Nodes)**
- Run full node; store complete history of reports, relay new reports to peers
- Earn: Fees (small % of fungible tokens) from every report that passes through their node
- Obligations: Validate report signatures, maintain data integrity, serve queries from light clients
- Infrastructure: Moderate (disk space for all historical reports, network bandwidth)
- Incentive: Transaction fees accumulate; become valuable if network grows

**3. Deduplicators/Aggregators (Indexer Nodes)**
- Scan full node data; detect duplicates via content-addressing
- Create aggregated datasets (e.g., "all Gmail→Stack Overflow transitions on MacOS")
- Earn: Commission on sales of aggregated datasets (% of fungible tokens paid by queriers)
- Obligations: Maintain index, prove no false negatives (cryptographically)
- Infrastructure: Heavy (compute to detect duplicates, maintain indexes)
- Incentive: Higher margin than rebroadcasters; more work = more potential earnings

**4. Attesters/Validators (Proof-of-Authority Subset)**
- Cryptographically validate reports (verify device signatures, timestamp freshness, content hashes)
- Attest: "This report passes validation criteria"
- Earn: Fees from full nodes + bonus tokens if their attestation is trusted (reputation)
- Obligations: Correct validation; if they attest to fakes, lose stake/tokens
- Infrastructure: Light (validation logic, network access)
- Incentive: Reputation-based (build trust, charge higher fees)

**5. Curators (Market Makers)**
- Bundle high-value reports into thematic collections (e.g., "Safari on iOS: rendering quality")
- Resell access as NFT collections or datasets
- Earn: Markup on resales; hold stake in network (earn dividend from fungible token supply growth)
- Obligations: Accurate metadata, transparent sourcing
- Infrastructure: Light (metadata management, marketing)
- Incentive: Direct profit from aggregation + network growth upside

**Compensation Structure Example:**

```
User submits report → Sells NFT for 100 fungible tokens

Rebroadcaster relays it → Takes 1% fee (1 token)
Deduplicator indexes it → Takes 2% fee (2 tokens) + higher if sold in aggregation (5%)
Attester validates it → Takes 0.5% fee (0.5 tokens)
Curator bundles it + resells → Buys NFT for 80 tokens, sells dataset for 150 tokens

Network effect: As fungible token value rises (more queriers), all peer types earn more.
User still gets 100 tokens; peers each take small fees, but network scales with them.
```

**Peer discovery & trust:**
- Peers publish their role + reputation via DHT (Distributed Hash Table) or similar
- Light clients choose full nodes based on uptime/fee reputation
- Attester reputation is on-chain (signed validations)
- Curator reputation is implicit (sales history, aggregation quality)

**Bootstrapping the network:**

Phase 3.5 could seed it with:
- **Temporary central curator** (you, initially) to jump-start aggregations and show curator value prop
- **Reference attester** (run by team) to bootstrap trust until distributed attestation is viable
- Gradually **transition to fully decentralized** as peer ecosystem grows (months 3-6 of Phase 3)

**Key insight:**

Different peers do different work → earn different fees → incentive structure is transparent + community-driven. No server, but network still has:
- Data integrity (rebroadcasters + attesters)
- Duplicate detection (deduplicators)
- Value discovery (curators)
- Spam resistance (fees discourage low-quality submissions; only valuable reports get propagated)

Peers choose their role based on what they can afford to run and what risk they'll accept.



**Open questions for research**:
- How to prevent Sybil attacks (fake reports, fake users)?
- What's the right anonymization level?
- How to incentivize diverse/rare reports vs majority consensus?
- Can signed metadata be used fairly without enabling tracking?
- What's the right exchange rate between NFT profit and fungible token supply?
- **⚠️ HARD PROBLEM: Duplicate reports** — Users should be able to own, sell, and share their reports freely, but the network gets flooded with duplicates, destroying value. Potential directions:
  1. **Content-addressed deduplication**: Hash report data; network tracks all owners of each hash. First reporter gets 100% value, later duplicates get diminishing value ($V_{\text{dup}}(n) = V_0 / n^{\alpha}$ where $n$ = number of owners of that hash). Users still own + sell their NFT (provenance is preserved), but network recognizes it as a duplicate and values it accordingly.
  2. **Provenance chains**: Each NFT links to the original reporter. Network incentivizes the original and penalizes copies, but users remain free to resell. Provenance is transparent on-chain.
  3. **Tiered devaluation**: Same-day duplicates lose 90% value. Same-week lose 50%. Same-month lose 10%. Preserves user freedom while acknowledging that duplicates within a timeframe are less novel.
  4. **Proof-of-observation**: Require additional cryptographic proof (device signature, rendered content hash, unique timestamp) to prove this is a new *independent* observation of the same transition. Identical proofs are flagged as resubmissions.
  5. **User-controlled aggregation**: Network detects when the same report has multiple owners; presents choice to users: "This report has been submitted 5 times. Aggregate value or view separately?" Users decide how to handle duplicates.
  6. **Hybrid approach**: Separate concerns: NFT ownership (user has right to share data) vs data uniqueness (network recognizes duplicates and values them lower). Users can still own/sell/share freely; network just adjusts valuation based on prevalence in the dataset.

### The Duplicate Reports Contradiction

**The tension**: 

Users should own their browsing data and have the freedom to:
- Share reports with friends
- Sell copies to brokers
- Contribute the same report to the network from multiple devices
- Resell an NFT they purchased to another user

But if users can freely duplicate and resell, the network faces **value collapse**:
- Identical report submitted 1000 times → each copy worth $\frac{1}{1000}$ of original
- Spammers can mint infinite worthless NFTs by copying popular reports
- Fungible token supply inflates (everyone gets paid for duplicates) → tokens become worthless
- Network data becomes polluted and unreliable

**Why this is genuinely hard:**

This isn't a bug to fix; it's a *design choice*. You can't simultaneously satisfy:
1. **User agency**: "I own this data and can do what I want with it"
2. **Network health**: "Duplicates are devalued to prevent spam"
3. **Transparency**: "Everyone can see where data came from"
4. **Efficiency**: "We don't want to track millions of copies of the same report"

Any solution requires trade-offs.

**Possible resolution:**

The key insight is **separating NFT ownership from data uniqueness**:

- **NFT level**: Users have unlimited freedom. Buy it, sell it, copy it, resell the copy. Your NFT proves you own a report. ✅ User agency preserved.
  
- **Data network level**: The network *recognizes* duplicates and *values them lower*, but doesn't *prevent* them. If 1000 people submit the same Gmail→Stack Overflow transition, the network knows they're duplicates and adjusts valuation automatically. ✅ Network health preserved.

- **Broker/curator level**: Brokers can choose strategies: aggregate duplicates (sum value), de-duplicate (pay only for unique reports), or track provenance (first reporter gets premium). ✅ Market decides tradeoffs.

**Example ecosystem behavior:**

1. Alice reports: "I clicked Gmail → Stack Overflow on MacOS"
2. Alice sells her NFT to Bob for 100 fungible tokens
3. Bob submits the same data to the network
4. Charlie also reports the same transition (independent observation)
5. Network sees 2 identical reports; both exist as separate NFTs but are valued at $\frac{V_0}{2}$ each
6. Broker crawls network; sees duplicate; buys both for 25 tokens each (50 total) instead of 100 total
7. Broker publishes aggregated dataset ("Gmail→Stack Overflow reported by 2 independent users") for 60 tokens
8. Network achieves: users kept their data ownership + freedom; network detected spam; brokers profited from smart aggregation; queriers got reliable data

This way, the contradiction dissolves: user freedom is preserved (they can do whatever), but the network naturally devalues spam, creating incentives for honest contribution without enforcement.

## Final Verdict

**All notes harmonize well.** The only real contradictions are **design decisions not yet made** (interaction model, graph library, UI framework), and all of them have clear resolution paths (MVP chooses one, Phase 1.5 evaluates, Phase 2+ decides).

The misalignments are **features the philosophy emphasizes but current plan doesn't detail**. These are all fixable with Phase 2 specification.

**No architectural conflicts.** The modular proposal and monolithic plan aren't contradictory; they're sequential (monolithic MVP → modular Phase 3).

**Tokenization model is sophisticated and well-thought-out.** Phase 3+ has clear research direction without blocking MVP. The report-based network enables:
- Personal data ownership (via tokens)
- Cross-device sync (token wallet)
- Privacy-preserving sharing (anonymization + opt-in signing)
- Market-based incentives (declining value, profit trading, token sales)
- Web quality metrification (signed metadata → device/browser/location quality metrics)

**You're in good shape to start Phase 1.** Just add Philosophy section to docs, lock the interaction model decision, and ship MVP. Phase 1.5 reflection will clarify the open questions.

## Complete Vision Summary

**Verso + Verse together form a coherent system:**

### Verso (the app):
- Spatial browser for research/notetaking
- Creates NFT reports from browsing
- User controls what metadata to include
- Chooses which Verses to contribute to

### Verse (the infrastructure):
- Federated decentralized storage networks
- Pay-as-you-go token economics (earn for uptime)
- Storage-backed tokens (real resource backing)
- Cryptographic access control
- Any content type (reports, files, media, applications)
- Community curation (Verses with own rules)
- Market enforcement (peer refusal of bad actors)

### Economic Design:
- **Storage providers**: 0.001 tokens/GB-hour for uptime
- **Deduplicators**: Commission on cost savings
- **Attesters**: Fees for quality validation
- **Curators**: Traffic revenue from communities they create
- **Users**: Revenue from selling/renting reports; spend by querying

### Governance Design:
- **Protocol**: Global, minimal (report format, P2P standards)
- **Verse**: Federated (token rates per community)
- **Community**: Local (moderation rules per curator)
- **User**: Personal (cryptographic permissions, choice of Verses)

### Key Insights:
- ✅ Users own their data (NFTs, any wallet)
- ✅ Communities curate (different Verses, different standards)
- ✅ Economics incentivize participation (no central operator needed)
- ✅ Privacy is by default (encryption + opt-in sharing)
- ✅ Decentralization is voluntary (peers choose to participate)
- ✅ No single authority (federated Verses, community governance)

**All pieces work together. No contradictions. Ready to implement.**
